IDEA: dbd-like game. 
- sky-camera that tracks where player is (2, 3)
- teleporters that change player position (3)
- if camera loses player, randomly scans maze, re-locks if within area (3)
- breakable doors that dissapear if player runs into them fast enough (3, 4)
- traps that slows player speed (3)
