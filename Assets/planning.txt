1) A Manager class that handles a system and interacts with objects [2 points]
2) Multiple forms of random generation [2 points]
	Can be multiple types of object spawning, variance on values on pre-spawned objects, or editor generation (must show in video!) 
3) Use a Coroutine in at least one of your scripts [2 points]
4) Pooled objects that enable/disable when activated and deactivated [2 points]
5) Weighted random on table of output (loot box)

IDEA: dbd-like game. 
- camera/eye coroutine to look for player, stop coroutine if player is found (3). camera randomly scans area (2)
- refactor level script to manage all objects within level (1)
- light source, disable light randomly (2)
- powerup with random locations that respawn in random locations; from a set; effect is random (4,2,5)
