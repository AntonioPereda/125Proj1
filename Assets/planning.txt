WHATS LEFT FOR: dbd-like game. 

1) add sound (make sure to credit) --
2) finish camera --
4) polish level --

3) finish "green thingies" and make "generated dynamically based on the player" + game logic
	* caught by camera -> 30 sec timer
	* green thingies randomly spawn via gen of player location
	* dont get all 5 = game over
	* get all 5 = camera is forced off you, timer stops/resets
